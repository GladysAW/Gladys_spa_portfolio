            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              In highschool, one of my math teachers, used to write equations on
              the board, and reward the fastest student who solves them with
              candy. By the end of the day, I was the geek with the most
              bonbons. They didn't taste so good..but the rush of winning always
              tasted sweet üòè
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast-forward a few years, I had my first job as a bank agent
              working with numbers and money! Passion and self-drive are
              qualities I carried with me through my career. It always gave me a
              sense of pride to leave a positive impact at every stage during my
              9+ years of working in the banking and financial tech sector.
            </p>
            <p>
              However my interest in technology and my passion to become a
              developer led me to make a bold switch in my career and pursue
              programming. So I joined a full-stack web development course and
              I'm currently spending many hours every day learning to code.
              Currently I'm really enjoying solving JavaScript challenges and
              using React.js as a library, which to be honest, I'm finding much
              more fun than just styling with css!
